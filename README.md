# AresTools

This package contains simple Python scripts and packages to be used
as import and monitoring tools for the HMS application ARES.

Note that the Python code in this package is written with the Python 2-3
compatibility in mind.  Please, do not hesitate to contact the Euclid 
SOC Team or the responsible for this code in case you detect some 
compatibility issues.

This is still a work in progress.  It can be considered as the version 0.0.1.
